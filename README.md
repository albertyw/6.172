6.172
=====

Dump of the git repositories from my old 6.172 Performance Engineering of Software Systems Class that I took in 
Fall 2011.  

Project 0 - A simplistic hands on project involving an introduction to C, debugging, and compiling.  

Project 1 - Another simplistic project involving C, performance profiling, and bithacks in order to optimize a 
merge sort algorithm, partially done with a partner.

Project 2.1 - A project that wrote quick sort, matrix multiplication, and N-bodies physics simulation to practice 
using Intel Cilk Plus, locking, and non-locking parallelization

Project2.2 - An open-ended project that implemented a parallelized collision detection and rebound algorithm, ostensibly
with a partner

Project3 - Implementing a parallelized memory allocator (optimizing both time and space), also ostensibly with a 
partner

Project4 - Optimizing a khet board game AI
